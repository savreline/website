          <p>An individual course project for the distributed systems abstractions graduate course. Designed 
            and implemented three different variants of a replicated, multi-primary key-value store that achieves
            eventual consistency via conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs).&nbsp;
            <a href="https://github.com/savreline/chevrotain">GitHub</a></p>
          <p>Compared and contrasted performance of the different variants by subjecting them to various
            loads while deployed on ten geographically distributed Azure VMs. One of the variants achieved
            a sub-second latency under a throughput of 10 000 operations per second and out-performed MongoDB's 
            built-in replication service (which follows the primary-backup model) under this load.&nbsp;

          <p>While working on the project, contributed a new feature and repaired a bug in GoVector, a 
            UBC distributed system research group's open source Golang library.&nbsp;
