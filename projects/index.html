          <p>Designed and implemented in Go three different variants of a replicated, multi-primary key-value
            store that achieves eventual consistency via conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs).
            The underlying database is MongoDB, all inter-replica communication is via RPC.</p>
          <p>Compared the performance of the three variants by subjecting them to various
            loads while they were deployed on ten geographically distributed Azure VMs. One of the variants achieved
            a sub-second latency under a throughput of 10 000 operations per second and, as per one metric, 
            outperformed MongoDB's built-in replication service under this test.</p>
          <p>While working on the project, repaired a bug in and added a new feature to GoVector, a 
            UBC distributed systems research group's open source Go library.</p>
