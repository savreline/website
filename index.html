                <p>I am a recent graduate from the Bachelor of Computer Science program at UBC with 
                  prior education and experience in advanced mathematics, physics, chemical and 
                  biomedical engineering. </p>
                <p>My recent focus in computer science has been in the areas of distributed systems,
                  computer networks and operating systems. However, I do have some exposure to 
                  full stack developement, machine learning, statistics, graphics and PL theory. </p> 
                <p>I am always eager to learn new technologies and learn them well! I pay strong 
                  attention to detail and take pride in the quality of finished product.</p>
